#  web.go

web.go is the simplest way to write web applications in the Go programming language. It's ideal for writing simple, performant backend web services. 


## Overview

web.go should be familiar to people who've developed websites with higher-level web frameworks like sinatra or web.py. It is designed to be a lightweight web framework that doesn't impose any scaffolding on the user. Some features include:

* Routing to url handlers based on regular expressions
* Secure cookies
* Support for fastcgi and scgi
* Web applications are compiled to native code. This means very fast execution and page render speed
* Efficiently serving static files

## Specific to this fork

This is the combination of github.com/ungerik/web.go and github.com/rday, both forks of github.com/hoisie/web

Updates
* Added WebError for cleaner returns in handlers
* Added content-type and content-encoding to be in module list by default
* New method of creating content parsers
* Add TLS server support
* Add basic marshaling of return types (json, xml)
* Add module structure for Pre- and Post- request handling
* Add encoding module to handle gzip and deflate
* Unauthorized respose added
* WebError struct added to allow for detailed errors from the modules
* Modules MUST return an error or nil when finished. If an error is returned, then processing stops and the request is finished. This allows for immediate authentication checks that will kill the request on failure
* Support for several directories that serves static files


Initial TLS support is addded to this branch. A security expert should
probably sign off on this before it becomes a standard.

The following tweaks are present:

* new AdHoc function in the root. This lets the user run tests written like this...

```go
    func init() {
        // RegisterRoutes is defined in your main package and sets
        // up all the routes for the application
        RegisterRoutes();
    }

    func TestHelloWorld(t * testing.T) {
        recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()
        request, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", "/your/defined/route", nil)

        web.AdHoc(recorder, request)

        fmt.Println("Result", recorder.Body)
    }
```

* Added the generic interface "User" to a context. You can set this to whatever you want. 
* Added the ability to push "Modules" into the call stack. These are functions that will run before your main handler is. 

```go
	
	func helloModule(ctx * web.Context) error {
        ctx.User = doAuthentication(ctx)
		if ctx.User == nil {
            web.Unauthorized("Invalid Credentials")
            return web.WebError("Invalid Credentials")
        }

        // All is well
        return nil
	}

	func handler(ctx * web.Context) {
		message := ctx.User.(string)
		ctx.WriteString(message)
	}

	func main() {

		// this is optional, cool for testing when you want to clear
		// any modules already set up
		web.ResetModules()

		// will get called on all routes
		web.AddPreModule(helloModule)

        // preform any encoding that the client requests
        web.AddPostModule(web.EncodeResponse)

		// the module should get run just before this does
		web.Get("/", handler)

		// starts up the server and away we go!
		web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
	}
```

## Installation

Make sure you have the a working Go environment. See the [install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html). web.go targets the Go `release` branch. If you use the `weekly` branch you may have difficulty compiling web.go. There's an alternative web.go branch, `weekly`, that attempts to keep up with the weekly branch.

To install web.go, simply run:

    go get github.com/xyproto/web

To compile it from source:

    git clone git://github.com/xyproto/web.git
    cd web && go build

## Example
    
    package main
    
    import (
        "github.com/xyproto/web"
    )
    
    func hello(val string) string { return "hello " + val } 
    
    func main() {
        web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
        web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
    }

To run the application, put the code in a file called hello.go and run:

    go build hello.go
    
You can point your browser to http://localhost:9999/world . 

### Getting parameters

Route handlers may contain a pointer to web.Context as their first parameter. This variable serves many purposes -- it contains information about the request, and it provides methods to control the http connection. For instance, to iterate over the web parameters, either from the URL of a GET request, or the form data of a POST request, you can do the following:

    package main
    
    import (
        "github.com/xyproto/web"
    )
    
    func hello(ctx *web.Context, val string) { 
        for k,v := range ctx.Params {
            println(k, v)
        }
    }
    
    func main() {
        web.Get("/(.*)", hello)
        web.Run("0.0.0.0:9999")
    }

In this example, if you visit `http://localhost:9999/?a=1&b=2`, you'll see the following printed out in the terminal:

    a 1
    b 2

## Documentation

Online [API documentation](http://go.pkgdoc.org/github.com/xyproto/web)

If you use web.go, I'd greatly appreciate a quick message about what you're building with it. This will help me get a sense of usage patterns, and helps me focus development efforts on features that people will actually use.
